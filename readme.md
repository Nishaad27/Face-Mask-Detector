# Face Mask Detector

This project uses deep learning to detect whether a person is wearing a face mask or not. It utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for model training and Flask to serve the model via a web application.

## Features

- Upload an image through the web interface.
- Detect whether the person is wearing a face mask or not.
- Display the result as a label indicating the detection status.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Flask (for web app)
- TensorFlow/Keras (for training the deep learning model)
- OpenCV (for image processing)
- HTML/CSS (for the front-end)

## Setup

Follow these steps to set up the project locally.

### Prerequisites
